# Javascript Challenge: UFO Finder

Project Overview
----
For this assignment, I was tasked with writing code that would create a dynamic table on a webpage using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3. The dataset I was provided contained records of UFO sightings in different locations around the US.
The first part of this assignment (UFO-Level-1) required writing a JavaScript code that would append a table of the data to my webpage and allow users to filter through the table for a specific date. I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote a JavaScript code in my app.js file that would listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match the user input, and display these rows to the user.
The second part of this assignment (UFO-Level-2) required all of the criteria from UFO-Level-1, with the addition of adding filters for city, state, country, and shape, allowing the user to filter for data in multiple categories.
